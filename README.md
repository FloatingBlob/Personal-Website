looks pretty cool tho

To do list (in order):
- sizing fixes
- look into creating horizontal some sort of indicator for mobile slides

- penis eek music (mutable)
- speedrun timer (no longer counts up)

- look into jumpscare when button (spinner, blood, screen cracking, screen shake, crash?)

- look into animations e.g the text coming from the left and right
    - metallic rouge, cruella, that one up and down thing
