To do list:
- look into jumpscare when button (spinner, blood, screen cracking, screen shake, crash?)
- look into animations e.g the text coming from the left and right
    - metallic rouge, cruella, that one up and down thing
- penis eek music (mutable)
- speedrun timer (no longer counts up)
- djbouti voice over
- look into creating horizontal some sort of indicator for mobile slides
- take a look at how font sizing works when turned horizontally
